\chapter{Discussion}

%5-10 pages?

%Pre-text: discussion aims to answer each of the three research questions presented in the introduction
%Repeat the research questions here?

%Section 1: Iterative training in general
%In detail discuss how iterative training went, focusing on the aspect of iterative training

%Section 2: Parameter tuning of iterative training
%Go into the information found in the parameter search
%Already interesting known result, threshold had significant effect
%0.5 was "good" but few iterations on initial model, 0.6 and 0.7 collapsed into 2 classes, 0.8 and 0.9 kept 3 classes
%Because of time constraints, decision to go with 0.8 was made based on it being a more "balanced" number, faster tree generation, earlier use in development as "assumed good value"

%Section 3: Tree
%Discuss the trees generated, the results and how they compare
