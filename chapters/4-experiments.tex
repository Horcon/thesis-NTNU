\chapter{Experiments}

%Lots of graph pages in this section
%10-20 pages? but lots of pictures

%Section 1: Loss function hyperparams?
%Results justifying why I went with the loss function parameters, the final last result
%Q: Had a "bad" batch of results that maybe weren't as relevant, include but state it used an older version?

%Section 2: Iterative training
%Main section detailing the big results from iterative training, all different ways to arrange data
%Results meant to answer both first research questions, but not tied directly to them
%Provide as broad of a platform for discussion in the next section

%Section 3: Tree generation
%Same but for trees
%As many results as possible for the discussion section
