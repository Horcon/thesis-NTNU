\chapter{Methodology}

%Long(est) chapter of all probably, 10-20 pages
%Somewhat historical walkthrough through the thesis project, in order of how I did the tasks

%Section 1: Dataset (5+ pages)
%Detailed walkthrough of what I used as my dataset, processing it
%Q: Use the "Stage 1, 2, 3, 4" terminology used in the dataset preparation?

%Section 2: Neural network used
%Detail the methodology used in creating the "base" neural network used in this thesis
%Q: Some results here? Results that don't answer the questions but are relevant in development

%Section 3: Loss function
%In detail provide information on how I created my custom loss function filters, tuned the parameters
%Here is the reason I went down from 10 classes to 3
%Q: Provide this info 10->3 in methods or results? IMO methods but can see how it would be relevant in results

%Section 4: Iterative training
%First of the two sort of relevant to the results sections
%Specify the parameters used in determining the correct parameters in developing iterative training
%Specify what loss functions and parameters would used in iterative training depending on what results

%Section 5: Tree generation
%Tree generation, same as iterative training in terms of specifying what I did, results of this goes into results/discussion
%Specify what iterative training parameters will be used depending on the criteria in the results
