\chapter{Background}

%5 pages minimum!, hopefully 8-10 though doubt it

%Section 1 on neural networks and how they work, CNNs, Alexnet, Inception (but no further)
\section{Neural networks}

%General theory for what a neural network is
%Small figure showing what it looks like (simple neuron image thing)

\subsection{History}

%Rundown on nn history, 4 paragraphs
%p1: 70s-90s
%p2: 90s-alexnet
%p3: alexnet, illustration of alexnet
%p4: googlenet

\subsection{Convolutional neural networks}

%Rundown on what a CNN is, what it is used for
%Subsections for the direct explanation on the layers

%S0: dense layers, basic
\subsubsection{Dense layer}

%S1: conv layer (in particular the 1D version)
\subsubsection{Convolutional layer}

%S2: pooling layers, max and average
\subsubsection{Pooling layer}

%Custom images for all of this, but based on theory

%One more subsection tied to optimizers, loss functions and other stuff?
%Working title Gradient descent, uncertain if correct
\subsection{Gradient descent}
%Network needs to be trained to work, the process of adjusting this is (title of part)

\subsubsection{Optimizers}
%RMSProp, Adam (and variants), SGD?

\subsubsection{Loss functions}
%Categorical crossentropy

\subsubsection{Metrics}
%Loss number, accuracy

%Section 2 (probably earlier) on audio sample processing, what mfcc is, librosa
%Working title
\section{Audio processing}

\subsection{MFCC}

%1p about what MFCC is
%2 figures showing what mfcc is, dct 2 and 3
%1p explaining the difference?

\subsubsection{Applications}
%Pull some of the uses for mfcc papers here

%One more section on other ways to process audio, pick one of the options that were candidates later, cqt and the other maybe
\subsection{Other}

%Section 3 on trees, current existing methods of grouping data (agg, k-means etc)
%Working title, other can be 
\section{Data clustering}

%Explain the basics of clustering with the common one
\subsection{K-means}


%Explain the one used in the project
\subsection{Agg}

%rule of three, one more look over others
\subsection{Other}

%Section 4 on how both tie together somewhat, use Tree-CNN as base and work up the chain in references
\section{Neural networks and data clustering}


%Section 5 on iterative training, use Tree-CNN paper here too?
\subsection{Iterative training}
%F
%Find papers that reference this, explain the concept


%Figures:
%Small net figure - visio
%conv operation - visio?
%pooling operation - visio?
%optimizer?
%MFCC sample graph - python
%cqt graph - python
%agg cluster picture - scikit
%tree-cnn picture of cluster from that report, maybe custom
%iterative training ill - custom, if no good source found on this
